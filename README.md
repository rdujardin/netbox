NetBox is an IP address management (IPAM) and data center infrastructure management (DCIM) tool. Initially conceived by the network engineering team at [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), NetBox was developed specifically to address the needs of network and infrastructure engineers.

NetBox runs as a web application atop the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) Python framework with a [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) database. For a complete list of requirements, see `requirements.txt`. The code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/digitalocean/netbox).

The complete documentation for Netbox can be found at [Read the Docs](http://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
